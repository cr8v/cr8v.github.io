# Rewarding Chatbots for Real-World Engagement with Millions of Users
arxiv, [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ChaiML)
- This paper investigates the development of social chatbots that prioritize user engagement to enhance retention.
- The proposed approach uses human feedback and automatic pseudo-labels to train a reward model that can reject low-scoring sample responses generated by the chatbot model.
- The paper introduces intuitive evaluation metrics, such as mean conversation length, and reports A/B testing results that show an up to 70% increase in mean conversation length and more than 30% increase in user retention for a GPT-J 6B model.
- The paper also discusses future work aimed at using the reward model to fine-tune both the language model and the reward model.
