# Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools
- [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761.pdf)
- Language modeling, External tool integration, Self-supervised learning, Zero-shot learning, Downstream tasks
- LMs are goot at solving new tasks with just a few examples but struggle with some basic tasks. Toolformer is a model that can teach itself to use external tools via simple APIs and achieve better performance on downstream tasks without sacrificing its core language modeling abilities.
