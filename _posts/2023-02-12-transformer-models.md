[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07730.pdf), [website](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/))
- The scope of this review is to provide a catalog and classification of the most popular Transformer models that have been developed in recent years, and to introduce the most important aspects and innovations in Transformer models.

## A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT
YIHAN CAO (2023-03-07, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04226.pdf))

1️⃣ The scope of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the use of AI models to create digital content such as images, music, and natural language. The review covers the history of generative models, basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction, as well as existing open problems and future challenges in the field.

2️⃣ The key takeaways from this review are:
- ChatGPT, DALL-E-2, and Codex are examples of AI models that belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC).
- AIGC aims to make content creation more efficient and accessible through the use of AI models.
- Large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC, as they provide better intent extraction and lead to more realistic and high-quality content generation.
- The review covers the history of generative models and recent advances in AIGC from unimodal and multimodal perspectives, including text and image generation tasks and relative models, as well as cross-application between modalities.
- The review also discusses the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC, which can be useful for researchers and practitioners working in the field.
